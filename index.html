				<div class="topicContent"><p>The World Wide Web is a collection of webpages, images and interactive content (<em>Web applications</em>) connected together by links (<em><b>Hyperlink</b>s - commonly abbreviated to link</em>)  .</p>
					<h4>Key Components of the Web:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>The Browser on My Computer</li>
						<li>The  Webserver - located 'out there' - on the Cloud</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These two elements communicate via <b>HTTP</b> (<em><b>H</b>yper <b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol</em>).  The browser sends a request and the webserver returns the requested webpage.</p>
					<h4>How does the webserver know which page to the browser?</h4>
					<p>The browser requests a page by clicking on a Hyperlink which contains a reference to a <b>URL</b> (<em><b>U</b>niorm <b>R</b>esource <b>L</b>ocator</em>) which is <b>unique</b> to each page on the web.</p>

					<p>Webpages are documents of type <b>HTML</b> (<em><b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage</em>).</p>
					<p>HTML comprises four key types of things:</p>
					<ol type="1">
						<li>text (what you see)</li>
						<li>markup (what it looks like)</li>
						<li>references to other documents (video and images))</li>
						<li>links to other pages</li>

							<p>The contents of an HTML Document is made up of Elements.</p>
							<p>All Elements are rectangluar in shape.</p>
							<p>HTML &lt;tags&gt; are used to markup these Elements.</p>
							<p>These &lt;tags&gt; tell the browser how to handle the individual elements of the webpage.</p>
							<h4>There are two major types or elements:</h4>
							<ul>
								<li><b>Inline Elements</b><br>Simple in nature and have only content and occupy only the space they need.</li><br>
								<li><b>Block Elements</b><br>Contained within a virtual box and have height and width attributes as well as other potential.  <b><em>By default they occupy the full width of the webpage</em></b>.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><br><br>
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="lastColumn">
							<p>Most Elements are written with an opening tag, content and a closing tag.<br>eg. <b>&lt;tag&gt;content&lt;/tag&gt;.</b>.</p>
							In addition, some elements (like images and links) can have (an) attribute(s) which have names and values.<br>eg. <b>&lt;tag attributeName="value"&gt;content&lt;/tag&gt;</b></br>
							<p>The are also a number of tags which are referred to as <b>void tags</b> which don't have either content or a closing tag.<br>Examples:<br><b>The image element: &lt;img src="<em>url</em>" alt="text" &gt;</b><br>
							(note: the 'alt' attribute is not compulsory but is important as it is what will be displayed if there is an error/break in the link to the image url.  It is also helpful for blind users.)<br><br><b>The Line Break element: &lt;br&gt;</b></p>

							<p>Like my brother Mark, computers are stupid, they do what you ask ... nothing more, nothing less.</p>
							<p>Remember, you are far smarter than the computer, it will only do exactly what you ask it.  It has no ability to make a 'best guess' as most humans can if it receives a slightly ambiguous/incorrect instructrution.</p>
							<p><b>So remember:</b> Exact instructions (<em><b>syntax</b></em>) must be used.  Small <b>typos will NOT be forgiven</b>.</p>
							</div> 
							<div class="lastColumn">
							<p>Mark <span style="color: green"><em>a serious teenage wiseass at the time</em></span> asks:
							''Mum, more tea?''<br>
							'Yes, please' she replies.<br>
							Mark proceeds to pour tea all over the table.<br>
							'What do you think you're doing?' Mum demands.<br>
							'You never said you wanted it in a cup' was the too clever reply.</p>
							<p>Lesson learned!!</p>
